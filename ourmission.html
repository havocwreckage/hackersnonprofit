    <h1>How This Works</h1>
    <p>At My2ndChance, we have partnered with several homeless shelters and nearby companies to not only provide constant shelter but also jobs to the homeless. We function by having the homeless who apply through our site, agree to monthly drug screening. Those that are able to manage sobreity will continously be given a guaranteed spot to stay at one of our partner's shelters. In addition to a guaranteed stay, our applicants will also receive a chance to get back into the workforce whether or not they have a bad record that would otherwise inhibit their chances at getting a job outside of this program. We believe everybody deserves a second chance. It doesn't matter what past actions they may have committed in the midst of bad judgement. We believe in reform, we believe in a world where every human being is treated fairly and with love. We're trying to change the stigma that people have towards the homeless. 11% of the adult homeless population are veterans and 40% of all adult homeless are minorities that someone somewhere neglected along the way and we're all they have left. At My2ndChance we believe in second chances and the motto "nobody gets left behind". We're not just trying to give all of the homeless we can, a place to stay and a job; we're trying to revolutionize the way people and the social system views homeless.</p>
